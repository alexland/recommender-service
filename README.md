## Why Implement a Recommendation Engine as a Web Service?

* [separation of concerns](#separation-of-concerns)

* [interface familiar to devs](#familiar-to-devs)

* [ML models can be built & retrained outside of the main app's release cycle](#)

* [the algorithm underlying the RE can be revised or replaced without change to the interface](#)

* [RESTFUL routing is a nice way to implement "context"-dependence without requiring supplied parameters](#)


#

to get a recommendation, just curl against an endpoint:

    ```
    curl http://my-recommender.com/home/ -d "45924"
    ```
